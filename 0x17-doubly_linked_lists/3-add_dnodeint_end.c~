 * add_dnodeint - Adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
 * @head: A pointer to a pointer to the head node of the list.
 * @n: The integer data to be added to the new node.
 *
 * This function creates a new node with the provided integer data and adds
 * it to the beginning of the given dlistint_t doubly-linked list. The head
 * pointer is updated to point to the new node, and the neighboring nodes'
 * pointers are adjusted accordingly.
 *
 * Return: A pointer to the newly added node, or NULL on failure.
